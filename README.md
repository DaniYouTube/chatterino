# Chatterino
Chatterino is intended to be a high-performance simple TCP chat.
There's way too much shit left to do:

 - [ ] Set nickname on user connect (not sha1 of user remote address :rolling_eyes:)
 - [ ] Registration/login system.
 - [X] Remove possible data races (*at least try to*).
 - [ ] Multiple nodes (communication between nodes via redis?)
 - [ ] Sent last few messages on user connect.
 - [ ] Build system.
 - [ ] Make Docker image and `docker-compose` to test system with multiple nodes/replicas.
 - [ ] Chat history via web (plain text, **no fancy shit here**).
 
 # Usage
